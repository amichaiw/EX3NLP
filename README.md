Sentiment Analysis with Stanford Sentiment Treebank: A Comparative Study of LSTM, Log-Linear, and Word2Vec Models

Utilized the Stanford Sentiment Treebank text to train three models: LSTM, Log-Linear with one-hot word embeddings and Log-Linear with word2vec embeddings. 
The goal was to predict whether the text is negative or positive, Sentiment Analysis.

Models were compared across three scenarios:
1. Regular texts
2. Texts with polarity (positive phrases containing negative sub-phrases)
3. Texts with rare words
